								<h2>Motivations and Overview</h2>
								<p>Neural network algorithms mimic neural networks in the brain in order to learn complex pattern recognition. Neural network algorithms are very useful for unstructured data like test and image recognition which likely are not best modeled by some kind of linear relationship. This method takes an input layer of training examples, runs them through a series of hidden layers which transform the data, and then translates them back out into an output layer, which are the predictions of the model. This process is referred to as the feedforward part of the algorithm, and is done one training example at a time. After the first example is run through the layers and results in a prediction, the correct actual value is then run backwards through the layers, and the value calculated at each layer using the actual value is used to tweak and optimize each layer. This part of the process is called backpropogation. The process is then repeated for each training example. Each layer of the process will be optimized to result in the best model, and the best predictions.</p>
								<h2>Application</h2>
								<p>For this project, I reconstructed a neural network to read greyscale images of single digit numbers in different fonts and return the predicted value represented in the image. I used a fairly simple neural network with in input layer, two hidden layers, and an output layer. This is a classification model with 10 classification groups (the numbers 0-9) which will output a matrix containing the predicted probability that the input image was each of the classification options. Then, the program returns the value with the greatest probability as the prediction.</p> 
								<p>First I wrote out a function to calculate the cost of the model. This is the feedforward step of the model. I used a sigmoid function that I constructed which applies the sigmoid function to the input. Before implementing this step, I also set random values to initialize the hidden layers, and unrolled them into vectors.</p>
								<pre><code>z_2 = [ones(m, 1) X] *Theta1'; 

a_2 = g_z_2 = sigmoid(z_2);


h = size(a_2, 1); 
%add a column of ones to a_2
a_2 = [ones(h,1) a_2];\

%enter second layer

z_3 = (a_2*Theta2'); 

a_3 = g_z_3 = sigmoid(z_3);

%Now to compute the cost

%turn the y vector into a 5000x10 matrix like a_3, where 0 when not that classifier and 1 when yes
ym = (eye(num_labels)(:,y))'; %[5000x10]

J = (1/m) * sum(sum((-ym.*log(a_3))-[(1-ym).*log(1 - a_3)]));

reg = [lambda/(2*m)] * [sum(sum(Theta1(:,2:end).^2)) + sum(sum(Theta2(:,2:end).^2))];
J = J + reg;</pre></code>
								<p>After computing the cost, I implemented a backpropagation algorithm to compute the gradients for each of the hidden layers.</p>
								<pre><code>
Delta_1 = 0;
Delta_2 = 0;

for t = 1:m;
  A_1(t,:) = [1 X(t,:)]; %[1 x 400]

  Z_2(t,:) = [A_1(t,:)] * Theta1'; %[1 x 401]*[401x25]
  G_2(t,:) = sigmoid(Z_2(t,:)); %[1x25]
  A_2(t,:) = [1 G_2(t,:)]; %[1x26]
  Z_3(t,:) = A_2(t,:) * Theta2'; %[1x26]*[26x10]
  A_3(t,:) = G_3(t,:) = sigmoid(Z_3(t,:)); %[1x10]

  %turn y(i) into a row of 0s and 1s
  yy(t,:) = (eye(num_labels)(:,y(t)))'; %[1 x 10]
  del_3(t,:) = A_3(t,:) - yy(t,:);%[1x10] - [1x10]
  del_2(t,:)= (del_3(t,:)*Theta2).*((A_2(t,:).*(1-A_2(t,:))));%[1x10]*[10x26] .*[1x26].*[1x26]

  len = size(del_2)(2);
  Delta_2 = Delta_2 + ((A_2(t,:)') * del_3(t,:)); %[26x1] *[1x10]
  Delta_1 = Delta_1 + (del_2(t,2:len)' *((A_1(t,:))));%[25x1]*[1x401]
  %Delta_1 = Delta_1 + ((A_1(t,:)))'*(del_2(t,2:len));%[401x1]*[1x25]

  Theta2_grad = (Delta_2/m)'; %[10x26]
  Theta1_grad = (Delta_1/m); %[25x401]
  size(Theta1_grad);
  size(Theta2_grad);
end</pre></code>
								<p>This part of the function loops through each example, applying the hidden layers to transform the data, and then learning the gradient of each layer, and changing the hidden layer in accordance. This way, as each example gets looped through, the hidden layers get better and better, resulting, ideally, in a good model by the end of the loop.</p>
								<p>Finally, I implemented regularization for each of the hidden layers</p>
								<pre><code>j = size(Theta1)(1);
k = size(Theta2)(1);

reg_1 = (lambda/m)*[zeros(j, 1) Theta1(:,2:end)];

Theta1_grad = Theta1_grad + reg_1;

reg_2 = (lambda/m)*[zeros(k,1) Theta2(:,2:end)];

Theta2_grad = Theta2_grad + reg_2;</pre></code>
