								<h2>Background and Goals</h2>
								<p>This data used for this project contains the age, sex, B.M.I., number of children, smoking status, region of the U.S., and charges billed to insurance for one year. I approached this project with the goal of predicting insurance charges based on this information. This kind of predictive modeling is useful in every field. It is very powerful to be able to make predictions about consumers/clients based on information that is readily available to you. Of course, in this situation, an insurance company might like to know how much an individual is likely to bill insurance so that they can set their insurance rate at a level that maximizes profit. </p>
								<p>I was hoping to practice machine learning techniques and data preprocessing. I used Python to preprocess the data and GNU Octave for the data analysis.</p>
								<h2>Getting Started</h2>
								<p>The first step was to process the categorical features into binary operators. I lieu of using pandas' get_dummy operator, I challnged myself to code this part from scratch. I hadn't been using Python very much lately and wanted to keep myself in practice. The following code transforms the smoking status (previously labeld as "yes" or "no") to a new vaiable "is_smoker" with a 1 or 0 label. It also transfroms the individuals region from "northeast," "northwest," "southeast," or "southwest" into four dummy variables: "is_northeast," "is_northwest", "is_southeast," "is_southwest." Each example in the data set will present with a 1 for the proper variable and 0s for the remaining three. This step allows each of the features to be mathematically manipulated.</p>
								<p>The following is the code I used for this step:</p>
